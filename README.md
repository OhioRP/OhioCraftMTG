  The minetest-based game for Ohio RP
<p>

The modification pack for The Ohio RP Custom Minecraft (OhioCraft). This is meant to be used as a modpack for the [`minetest`](https://github.com/minetest/minetest) engine.
To get more info about the [Utils](./Utils/) folder, read [Utils](#utils).
To get more info on the remaining stuff that needs to be implemented in [`PortCraft`](./PortCraft/), check [`blocklist.txt`](./blocklist.txt).

## Quick Start
```console
$ ./install.sh # will install to `~/.minetest/mods/ohiocraft`
```

## Utils

Useful scripts meant to make the development process easier.

### `parse_blocs_json.py`

A script that will parse [`blocks.json`](#blocksjson) and generate a list of blocks in `file.txt`.

#### `blocks.json`

A file containing Minecraft: Java Edition block data. Can be generated by downloading the server and running:
```console
$ java -DbundlerMainClass=net.minecraft.data.Main -jar server.jar --all
```
The generated `blocks.json` will be located at `./generated/reports/blocks.json`.
