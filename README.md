## Utils

Useful scripts meant to make the development process easier.

### `parse_blocks_json.py`

A script that will parse [`blocks.json`](#blocksjson) and generate a list of blocks in `file.txt`.

#### `blocks.json`

A file containing Minecraft: Java Edition block data. Can be generated by downloading the server and running:
```console
$ java -DbundlerMainClass=net.minecraft.data.Main -jar server.jar --all
```
The generated `blocks.json` will be located at `./generated/reports/blocks.json`.
