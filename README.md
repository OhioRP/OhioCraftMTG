# OhioCraftMTG

Stands for "OhioCraft Minetest Game". <br>
After some time developing this, I've come to the conclusion that it would be easier to make OhioCraft a patch for [MineClone2](https://git.minetest.land/MineClone2/MineClone2). For the newer version, please visit [OhioCraft](https://github.com/OhioRP/OhioCraft).
